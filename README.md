# Simple Calculator Project

This is a Simple Calculator project implemented in Java as part of the preparation for the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) final exam. The project includes a Graphical User Interface (GUI) based on Swing and utilizes an algorithm inspired by LeetCode's Basic Calculator III problem. Although the project was completed within a limited time frame of one hour, there is room for further optimization and improvement.

## Features
**GUI Using Swing:** The calculator provides a user-friendly interface for performing a simple arithmetic calculations.

**Basic Calculator III algorithm:** The project incorporates an algorithm inspired by LeetCode's Basic Calculator III problem to handle arithmetic calculations.

**Error handling:** Currently, the project lacks error handling. Future improvements can focus on adding proper error handling mechanisms.

## Usage
To use the Simple Calculator project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/abdulmunimjemal/SimpleCalculator.git
```
2. Open the project in your preferred Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE). (IntelliJ in my case)

3. Change the icon file path on line 26

4. Compile and run the project.

**Result:** The GUI of the calculator will be displayed, allowing you to perform basic calculations.

## Future Improvements
Here are some areas where the Simple Calculator project can be further improved:

**Error handling:** Implement error handling mechanisms to handle scenarios such as an invalid input.

**Algorithm optimization:** Explore opportunities for optimizing the calculation algorithm to improve performance.

**Extended functionality:** Add support for additional mathematical operations or scientific calculator features.
